Cloudflare Pages offers one of the best platforms for deploying static sites with global CDN distribution, automatic HTTPS, and seamless GitHub integration. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

## Why Choose Cloudflare Pages?

Cloudflare Pages stands out from other static hosting platforms with several key advantages:

### Performance Benefits
- **Global CDN**: 200+ data centers worldwide
- **Edge optimization**: Content served from the nearest location
- **HTTP/3 support**: Latest protocol for faster connections
- **Brotli compression**: Better compression than gzip

### Developer Experience
- **Git integration**: Automatic deployments from GitHub/GitLab
- **Preview deployments**: Every pull request gets a preview URL
- **Custom domains**: Easy domain management with automatic SSL
- **Analytics**: Built-in web analytics without tracking scripts

## Setting Up Your First Deployment

### Prerequisites
- A static site repository on GitHub or GitLab
- A Cloudflare account (free tier available)

### Step 1: Connect Your Repository

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Click "Create a project"
4. Connect your GitHub or GitLab account
5. Select your repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Cloudflare Pages supports many frameworks out of the box:

```yaml
# For Astro projects
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist

# For Next.js
Build command: npm run build && npm run export
Build output directory: out

# For React/Vite
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Set up any required environment variables in the Pages dashboard:

```bash
NODE_VERSION=18
NPM_VERSION=8
ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Build Commands

For complex build processes, you can customize the build pipeline:

```bash
# Install dependencies and build
npm ci && npm run build

# Run tests before building
npm run test && npm run build

# Build with specific Node version
node --version && npm run build
```

### Redirects and Rewrites

Create a `_redirects` file in your build output directory:

```
# Redirect old URLs
/old-page /new-page 301

# SPA fallback
/* /index.html 200

# API proxy
/api/* https://api.example.com/:splat 200
```

### Headers Configuration

Add custom headers with a `_headers` file:

```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

/assets/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## Custom Domains

### Adding Your Domain

1. Go to your Pages project settings
2. Click "Custom domains"
3. Add your domain name
4. Update your DNS records as instructed

### DNS Configuration

For apex domains, use CNAME flattening:

```dns
example.com CNAME your-site.pages.dev
www.example.com CNAME your-site.pages.dev
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Cloudflare automatically optimizes images:

```html
<!-- Automatic WebP conversion and resizing -->
<img src="/image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
```

### Caching Strategy

Leverage Cloudflare's caching with proper headers:

```javascript
// In your build process
export default {
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        assetFileNames: 'assets/[name].[hash][extname]'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Web Analytics

Enable Cloudflare Web Analytics for privacy-friendly tracking:

1. Go to your domain in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to "Analytics" > "Web Analytics"
3. Enable analytics and add the beacon to your site

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor your site's performance with:
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Speed insights
- Geographic performance data

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

Common solutions for build failures:

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Use specific Node version
echo "18" > .nvmrc

# Increase memory limit
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
```

### Deployment Issues

Check these common problems:
- Incorrect build output directory
- Missing environment variables
- Node version compatibility
- Build command errors

## Best Practices

### Security
- Enable security headers
- Use HTTPS redirects
- Implement CSP headers
- Regular dependency updates

### Performance
- Optimize images before upload
- Minimize JavaScript bundles
- Use efficient caching strategies
- Leverage Cloudflare's minification

### Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track deployment success rates
- Monitor error rates
